# Background
The general objectives of my brainhack project is to learn the most efficient way to organise and analyse resting-state functionnal MRI data. My Ph. D. project will be to assess if the default-mode network (DMN) differs between MCI subject with and without depressive symptoms and if the DMN is a predictor of cognitive decline towards dementia. Before that, I did a Baccalauréat en sciences biomédicales, a Maîtrise en microbiologie-immunologie and a Baccalauréat en psychologie. I've work mainly on behavorial test in mice, metabolism of neutrophils and sterile inflammation as seen in autoimmune disease.
# Specific learning objectives
* Learn how to use NIAK and fMRIprep for preprocessing
* Start to think about the analysis of rsfMRI data
* Learn how to visualize and present nicely my results
* Understand Python enough to know what I’m doing when using a pipeline
