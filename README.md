# Background
The general objectives of my brainhack project is to learn the most efficient way to organise and analyse resting-state functionnal MRI data. My Ph. D. project will be to assess if the default-mode network(DMN) differs between MCI subject with and without depressive symptoms and if the DMN is a predictor of cognitive decline towards dementia.
